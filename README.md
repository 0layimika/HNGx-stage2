# API Documentation
# Overview
This document provides an overview of the API structure and key components of the API. It is pertinent to note that this API was created with the assumption that more than a person can have the same name and details, they are differentiated by an automatically generated id.
# Getting Started
To run the API locally, follow these steps:
### Prerequisite:
- Python and Django must be installed most importantly</li>
- Refer to requirements.txt for other required installations</li>
## Running the API
- Run the start command : Python manage.py runserver
## Folder Structure

The API project has the following folder structure. It is important this outlines only the vital files and folders responsible for the running of the API: 
- `CRUD_API`
  - `Settings.py`:contains all the settings of the entire running of the api
